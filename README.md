TALib.NETCore is an **unofficial** .NET Core port of the Technical Analysis Library (TA-Lib) - open-source ANSI C library of functions for technical analysis of financial time series data. It is written entirely in C# for the .NET platform. This repository contains the source code of the lastest version of the library released under The 3-Clause BSD License. This makes it free to use, even in commercial projects, with some restrictions.
